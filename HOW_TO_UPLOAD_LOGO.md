# How to Upload Logo to Navbar

## Step 1: Log in to WordPress Admin
1. Go to: https://freshdewmedicalclinic.com/wp-admin
2. Enter your admin credentials

## Step 2: Upload Custom Logo
1. In the WordPress dashboard, go to: **Appearance** → **Customize**
2. Click on **Site Identity** (in the left sidebar)
3. Under "Logo", click **Select logo** (or "Change logo" if one exists)
4. Click **Upload files**
5. Choose your logo image file (PNG or JPG recommended)
   - Recommended size: At least 200×200 pixels for a square logo
   - The theme will automatically resize it to 44×44 pixels (rounded circle)
6. Click **Select** after upload
7. (Optional) You can crop the image if needed
8. Click **Publish** to save changes

## Alternative Method (Using Theme Settings)
If the above doesn't work:
1. Go to: **Appearance** → **Customize**
2. Look for **Site Identity** or **Header Settings**
3. Upload your logo there

## What Happens
- Your logo will appear in the navbar as a 44×44 pixel rounded circle
- It will display next to "FreshDew Medical Clinic" text
- The logo is fully responsive on mobile and desktop

## Troubleshooting
- If you don't see changes immediately, clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Or do a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
- LiteSpeed Cache will auto-purge when the logo is uploaded

## Current Logo Behavior
- If no custom logo is uploaded, it shows "FD" text in a blue circle
- Once you upload a logo, it replaces the "FD" placeholder
